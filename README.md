# Valorant-Basic
The case I have considered for this assignment is 'Compatibility for
'VALORANT' gameplay!' Valorant is an FPS shooting game. It is an online game.
So, it requires a good stable internet connection in order to play this game.
After installing, one needs to press start option to start this game. This game has
two major gameplay mode- 1. Unrated 2. Competitive.
Most of the players play competitive for getting the suitable rank and rank-up
purpose. But he/she cannot play competitive without winning at least 10 unrated
matches. After winning 10 unrated match he/she will be eligible for playing
competitive. It needs 5 players to start a match for a team. So, they can play among
the 5 friends, otherwise server will select random player for the remained
vacancy.
After starting match in competitive, each player has to select an agent for the
gameplay. The main agents are- Raze, Reyna & Omen. Without selecting an
agent, the match cannot be started. So, after selecting agents, the match will be
started. As it is an online based shooting game, players need good stable ping
condition. Ping below 100 MS is considered as a suitable condition for gaming,
otherwise, it is really tough to play VALORANT properly. If all the conditions
mentioned above are okay, then one can play VALORANT comfortably.
